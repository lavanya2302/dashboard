# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

#project overview
🚀 I’m excited to share my latest project – a React Dashboard Application!

🔗 Live Demo: https://react-dashboard-lavanya-s.netlify.app/

💻 What I used to build it:
⚛️ React.js (with Vite) → fast and modular UI development
🌐 React Router → navigation setup
🎨 Bootstrap 5 → responsive grid, navbar, and layout styling

📊 react-google-charts → for 4 types of interactive charts:
Line Chart
Column Chart
Area Chart
Pie Chart
🖥️ Custom Components → Navbar, Footer, Dashboard layout
🚀 Netlify → deployment and hosting

💡 What I learned:
✅ How to structure a dashboard with reusable components
✅ How to integrate charts into a React project
✅ How to make layouts responsive using Bootstrap
✅ How to deploy React apps live on Netlify

This project helped me gain hands-on practice with frontend frameworks and data visualization while building something functional and professional-looking. 🌟
